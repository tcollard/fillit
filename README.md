# Fillit

The goal of this project is to discover a recurrent problematic in programming:
the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, in
a resonable time.

In this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetriminos between them and
to determine the smallest square possible.

A Tetriminos is a geometric figure formed of 4 blockes.

to know more about the subject you can read the instruction in the
[PDF](https://github.com/tcollard/fillit/master/PDF/fillit.fr.pdf)

## Library used

allowed function of standard libc to developp the programs
+ exit
+ open
+ close
+ write
+ read
+ malloc
+ free

I use a custom library [libft](https://github.com/tcollard/libft)

## How to use it

```bash
$> make
$> ./fillit files_with_tetriminos
```
